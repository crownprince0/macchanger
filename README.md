# macchanger

Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

    Running the Script:
        Open a terminal on your computer.
        Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

    Understanding the Script:

        The script begins by importing the necessary module subprocess, which allows interaction with the shell to execute system commands.

        The script sets the interface variable to the name of the network interface you want to modify. In this case, it's set to "eth0," but you can change it to the appropriate interface name.

        The new_mac variable is assigned the desired new MAC address you want to assign to the interface. It's set to "00:55:21:47:29:67" in the script, but you can replace it with your desired MAC address.

        The script then proceeds to execute the following actions:

            Shutting Down the Interface: The script uses subprocess.run() to issue the command ifconfig eth0 down, effectively disabling the network interface.

            Changing the MAC Address: The script uses the ifconfig command to modify the MAC address of the interface. It executes the command ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:55:21:47:29:67 to set the new MAC address.

            Bringing the Interface Back Up: After changing the MAC address, the script brings the network interface back up by running the command ifconfig eth0 up.

    Running the Script:
        Make sure you have the necessary permissions to modify network interfaces. You may need to run the script as a superuser using the sudo command.
        Execute the script by running the command python script_name.py, replacing script_name.py with the actual name of the script file.

    Verification:
        The script provides feedback as it progresses, informing you about the steps it's taking. It displays messages like "Shutting down the interface," "Changing MAC address," and "Network interface turned ON !!!!" to keep you informed about its progress.

Important Notes

    While this script can be a handy tool, exercising caution is crucial. Changing the MAC address of a network interface can affect your network connectivity, and it's important to understand the implications before running such scripts.

    If you encounter permission errors when running the script, consider running it with administrative privileges using the sudo command.

    If you want to change the MAC address of a different network interface or to a different MAC address, modify the interface and new_mac variables in the script accordingly.
